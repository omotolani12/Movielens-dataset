# Movielens-dataset

Project Description
Use the MovieLens data set to create a network visualization to help understand user-user relationships and Movie-Movie relationships.

The output should be a nice network graph visualization that individuals can interact .
Ideally the result should show movies which are similar to each other but isolated from the rest of the movies and a similar thing for users.
The work was done to support a recommender system project.

See presentation File for more info.
